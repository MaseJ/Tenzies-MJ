# Tenzies
By: Mason Johnson
## Description
This was a simple project of the game tenzies. This was done using React.js. The game does what it is intended to do with additional features such as
tracking high scores and best times. Local storage is used to track this, so once the window is closed that data will be erased. Hooks such as useState and useEffect 
were used to track and keep code up to date with the user. 
## Future plans 
At the moment this project is done but do plan on adding more features soon. One being the ability for the user to pick a difficulty. So, instead of just ten dice,
there could be more or less. Also, another small feature was to remove the numbers off the dice and give them dots like actual dice.
